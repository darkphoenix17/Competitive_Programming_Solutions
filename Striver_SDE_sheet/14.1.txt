1) Initialize output array to all -1s.
2) Create an empty stack of indexes of items we have visited in the input array but don't yet know the answer for in the output array.
3) Iterate over each element in the input array:
	I) Is it smaller than the item indexed by the top of the stack?
		i) Yes. It is the first such element to be so. Fill in the corresponding element in our output array, remove the item from the stack, and try again until the stack is empty or the answer is no.
		ii) No. Continue to 3.2.
	II) Add this index to the stack. Continue iteration from 3.

Python Implementation:
def find_next_smaller_elements(xs):
    ys=[-1 for x in xs]
    stack=[]
    for i,x in enumerate(xs):
        while len(stack)>0 and x<xs[stack[-1]]:
           ys[stack.pop()]=x
        stack.append(i)
    return ys
